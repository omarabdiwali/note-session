# NotesSession

NotesSession is a Next.js application that allows users to create notes. It is typed using Markdown syntax, where it then is saved to a MongoDB database. Users sign in using OAuth, and notes are grouped using their importance and urgency label. 

The Markdown allows for all sorts of different ways to show your text, with it letting you use html, and allowing for mathematical syntax using LaTeX to be shown correctly. It also allows you to have code blocks within your note, making it easier to refer to certain parts if need be.
